## Introduction

This is the "complete" Stripes "platform". It consists simply of an
NPM [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) that
specifies the version of `@folio/stripes-core` and of any Stripes
modules you wish to make available as part of this platform
to generate client bundles along with a utility for generating
module descriptors for each Stripes module.

Please see the
[quick start guide](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes/blob/master/doc/quick-start.md)
for more information.

The `stripes.config.js` is a configuration for a specific tenant. In
general, a platform supports multiple tenants, each of which may
include a different set of the available modules.  You can copy the
`stripes.config.js` file to be your `stripes.config.js.local`
configuration file.

The `yarn.lock` and `*-install.json` files in this repository can be
used to build a FOLIO system with the components that represent the
latest, compatible set of FOLIO releases. For an example of how to deploy such a
system, see the
[Single Server Deployment Guide](https://juniper.docs.folio.org/docs/getting-started/installation/singleserverwithcontainers/).

Descriptions of key files and key branches of this repository and
how to change them are in the
[Release Procedures](https://dev.folio.org/guidelines/release-procedures/#add-to-platforms)
and in
[DevOps - Install Backend Module](https://dev.folio.org/guides/devops-install-backend-module/#platform-explanation).

## Supported releases

The master branch is for the next flower release,
[Morning Glory (R2-2022)](https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=79468624),
it is work in progress.

Only the two latest releases are supported with critical bug and security fixes:
* Branch [R1-2022](https://github.com/folio-org/platform-complete/tree/R1-2022) and the
  R1-2022-… tags of the [Lotus](https://wiki.folio.org/display/REL/Lotus+%28R1+2022%29+Release+Notes)
  release
* Branch [R3-2021](https://github.com/folio-org/platform-complete/tree/R3-2021) and the
  R3-2021-… tags of the [Kiwi](https://wiki.folio.org/display/REL/Kiwi+%28R3+2021%29+Release+Notes)
  release

Older releases have reached end-of-life and are out of support.

## Installation

Install platform dependencies
```
$ yarn config set @folio:registry https://repository.folio.org/repository/npm-folio/
$ yarn install
```

Note: A sharp-libvips NPM dependency is not fully compatible with Nodejs v16 and will
fail 'yarn install'.  To resolve this, set the following environment variable prior to
running 'yarn install' when Nodejs version is v16+:

```
CXXFLAGS="-std=c++17" 

```

## Build and serve

To build and serve `platform-complete` in isolation for development purposes, run the "start" package script.
```
$ yarn start
```

The default configuration assumes an Okapi instance is running on http://localhost:9130 with tenant "diku".  The options `--okapi` and `--tenant` can be provided to match your environment.
```
$ yarn start --okapi http://localhost:9130 --tenant diku
```

To build a `platform-complete` bundle for production, modify `stripes.config.js` with your Okapi and tenant, then run the "build" script, passing it the name of the desired directory to place build artifacts.
```
$ yarn build ./output
```

See the [build](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-cli/blob/master/doc/commands.md#build-command) and [serve](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-cli/blob/master/doc/commands.md#serve-command) command reference in `stripes-cli` for a list of available options.

## Tests

### Integration tests

Integration tests require a running Okapi.  The default configuration expects Okapi running on http://localhost:9130 with tenant "diku".  To build and run integration tests for `platform-complete` with these defaults, run the `test-int` script.
```
$ yarn test-int
```

To view tests while they are run, provide the `--show` option.
```
$ yarn test-int --show
```

To skip the build step and run integration tests against a build that is already running, provide the URL.
```
$ yarn test-int --url https://folio-testing.dev.folio.org/
```

As a convenience, `--local` can be used in place of `--url http://localhost:3000` for running tests against a development server that has already been started.
```
$ yarn test-int --local
```

### Regression tests

Regression tests for the entire platform and its apps can be run with the "test-regression" script.  This will invoke both cross-module tests defined in this platform's repository as well as all tests defined for the individual apps.

```
$ yarn test-regression --url https://folio-testing.dev.folio.org/
```

### Running specific tests

The `test-int` package script, when combined with the `--run` option, can be used for running specific tests for the platform and/or apps.  Use `WD` (working directory) when referencing platform tests, otherwise use the module app module name.

Example running "loan_renewal" test in `platform-complete`:
```
$ yarn test-int --run WD:loan_renewal
```

Example running "new_user" test in `ui-users`:
```
$ yarn test-regression --run users:new_user
```

## Build stripes using the Dockerfile
The included Dockerfile allows for building a container that serves the stripes platform using Nginx. Pass in the Okapi URL and tenant ID as build arguments. The defaults are shown below:

```
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --no-cache=true \
  --build-arg OKAPI_URL=http://localhost:9130 \
  --build-arg TENANT_ID=diku -t stripes .
```
The nginx server name can be passed to the container at runtime. The default value is `localhost` if no argument is passed. For example, to have nginx use `127.0.0.1` as the server name:
```
docker run stripes 127.0.0.1
```
